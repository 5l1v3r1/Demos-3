# About these demos

This is a set of interoperable and open source demos. You can watch their live version in the [MS Edge Dev Site](http://dev.modern.ie/testdrive/). The main goal of this one is to show new web features (supported by Microsoft Edge) in a way that work accross all modern browsers. If a feature is supported in a browser and the demo doesn't work as expected you should file a bug!  

Some of these demos have been migrated from the old TestDrive website (sometimes because they are still relevant, some others because we are bit too sentimental). Some others are new. In any case, we are working on adding more. We hope you find them interesting and helpful.
